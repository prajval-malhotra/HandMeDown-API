COVID-19 has impacted many people financially and reduced their available resources due to the closure of community centers and other public places. Since we’re unable to help the less fortunate in ways that we were previously able to, we were inspired to create something digital that could help others. Our app aims to do this by providing the less fortunate with clothes during these difficult times.

Hand Me Down is an app that connects people with extra clothes to those in need within a nearby area. Receivers, which are those looking to get clothing will be able to filter out options by size and gender, and swipe through them to look for items that they like. Swiping left will cycle to a new option, and swiping left will show additional details and contact info which will help you collect your new item. Donors can add pieces of clothes to the database, and remove when they’ve arranged a giveaway.
